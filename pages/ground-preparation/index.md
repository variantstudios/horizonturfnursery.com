Proper Ground Preparation for Sod Installation: When installing sod, there are two important factors: (1) proper preparation of the installation site and (2) the capability to harvest the sod. The following steps are essential to the establishment of a lawn:
 
#### 1) Prepare the site prior to the arrival of the sod.
* Remove weeds and debris.
* Establish a rough grade and eliminate low spots.
* Spread and rototill a minimum of three (3) cubic yards of organics per 1,000 square feet at least four (4) inches deep. Level and rake the installation site until it is smooth.
* Grade areas along sidewalks and driveways approximately one and one half (1 1/2) inches below top of concrete.

#### 2) Have on site all hoses and sprinklers for the initial watering.
* Make sure sprinkler system is performing properly.
* Understand the operation of your sprinkler clock for proper watering of the new and established lawn.

#### 3) Order sod to be delivered once site is prepared and the sprinkler system is understood and operating properly.
 
#### 4) Install the sod immediately after delivery.
* Arrange the rolls so there is a minimum amount of traffic on the prepared soil and the newly installed grass.
* Lay sod in a horizontal brick pattern. Once an area of approximately 15 feet by 15 feet has been laid, rolled 
* and fertilized, water immediately.
* The objective is not to let the sod dehydrate.
* Butt ends and sides of the sod strips making sure there is no overlapping.
* Fit the sod around obstacles or in smaller places by merely cutting the dirt side with a sod knife.

#### 5) Water properly.
* Once all the sod is laid, begin watering to build up the sub-soil moisture.
* This is the most critical time to apply water
* May require up to one half (1/2) inch of water per day for the first two to three (2-3) days.
* Probe the soil to determine if the moisture has penetrated at least four (4) inches.
* During the following two (2) weeks, the amount of water needed will be similar to the chart below.
* Each day may require more than one application depending upon wind and temperature.
* The reason for several light applications is to keep the root zone and blades moist.
* Week three (3) is used as a transition period from daily watering with frequent applications per day to an increased number of days between watering.
* During this time the grass should be ready for routine maintenance.
* By the end of the establishment period, the grass should be able to go several days between waterings depending on the season and weather.

#### 6) The approximate amount of water that needs to be applied each week for an average, traditional lawn to supplement normal rainfall is listed in the following chart:
* Data for the chart is based on historical averages. This is a guideline and is not a substitute for good judgment, reason and common sense. If we donâ€™t receive normal rainfall, then the amounts shown in the chart should be increased to gain the same results.
* If there is greater than normal rainfall, then the amount of supplemental water should be reduced.

#### 7) Measure the water applied by using rain gauges or cans placed on the lawn in areas covered by sprinklers.
 
#### 8) After initial three weeks, adjust watering times and sprinkler clocks to conform to the water restriction program in your area.
 
#### 9) Become aware of dehydration signs.
* Stage 1: grass has a purplish tint.
* Stage 2: blades turn steel gray and foot prints are left when walked upon.
* Stage 3: grass blades turn straw color.
