    bio: Horizon Turf Nursery was started in 1986 By Dick and his parents Richard and Jody Ruppel. That first year they planted only 30 acres of bluegrass. Over the next several years the company grew supplying landscape contractors with quality sod and superior service. Today we have almost 200 acres of turf in production along with another 200 acres of alfalfa and corn.

    bio: 'With little knowledge about sod, Jason started as a forklift operator in 1990. After educating himself through various classes on turf identification and turf maintenance practices, Jason continued his career in farm management and outside sales. Jason now dedicates his time to selling quality turf and managing installations for landscape contractors.'
